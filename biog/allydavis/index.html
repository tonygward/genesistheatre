                <h1>Biography: Ally Davis</h1>

                <p>In 1975 I was a member of the South Manchester Operatic Society, languishing in the chorus of The Mikado with Mary Clarke and John Rolt, when John saw an advert wanting singers to help to stage an amateur production of Hair. We went along
                    to the audition and were surprised at its informality, which was much less daunting than auditions for our own society. Mary and I were delighted to be offered two of the main parts and couldn't believe our luck. The rehearsal were
                    always great fun and Chris Fogg and Chris Dumigan were always an inspiration to us all because of their unflagging enthusiasm. </p>

                <p>Hair at Altrincham Garrick in February 1976 amazed half of the audience and perplexed the other half, but no one could doubt the enthusiasm and commitment of the cast. After Tom Wildern wrote in his review for the Evening News "YES THEY
                    DO THE NUDE SCENE" we sold out for the rest of the week! The old guard at the Garrick were a bit wary of us as a company and were sure we were all really the "hippies" that we portrayed on stage - men and women sharing dressing rooms
                    was frowned upon, although it is commonplace at the Garrick today! The aftershow party in my cellar on the Saturday night was like a wake and I remember Mike Cheeseman crying on my shoulder because it was all over. But of course it
                    wasn't all over. The resurrection for Swinton was amazing as, at the first get together, the dance routines were nearly move perfect and as a non dancer I found this staggering.</p>

                <p>Stag, in its first incarnation at the Garrick, was a bit perplexing for the cast and the audience alike. I loved the music and enjoyed singing the songs but found the story a bit hard to get to grips with. In its revival at The Royal Exchange
                    in 1979 it worked so much better and the intimidating presence of the chorus in the auditorium before the show added to the atmosphere of menace. </p>

                <p>Another highlight was recording Stag at Pennine Studios in Oldham. What a pity Mike Mansfield and Robert Stigwood pulled out of the project.</p>

                <p>Tommy was another highlight of the Genesis years and was not without mishap for me. While performing for Altrincham festival at the Garrick I was badly burnt by a stage firework that had exploded up my right arm. I was rushed to Wythenshawe
                    hospital before the end of the performance but returned after the show to parade my bandage and have a much needed drink-what a trooper!</p>

                <p>When we performed Tommy at the Royal Exchange we were all amazed at the queues for returned tickets that snaked around the block and at the rapturous reception at the end of the show, a standing ovation is always terrific.</p>

                <p>If I have a favourite part, however, it would have to be Lucy in You're a Good Man Charlie Brown. I feel that the bossy Lucy was just me! I loved the songs, the clearly defined characters and the humour. But again, not without mishap for
                    me! On the way to rehearsals one Thursday I was knocked off my motorbike by some idiot in a car who pulled out of a side street staight in front of me. Again I was rushed to hospital and in the days without mobile 'phones could not
                    let anyone at the rehearsal know so they were no doubt cursing me for not bothering to turn up! Bad weather and a journalists strike conspired against us at Oldham and Charlie Brown turned into a disaster. I had to be sewn into my
                    costume each night, to accommodate my sling, and my face covered in thick makeup to hide my bruises and then we had to abort performances because the cast outnumbered the audience! Thank goodness we got the chance to play to a full
                    house at the Royal Exchange, but with an altered cast. The show was a great success, although Tom Wildern didn't get the point of Lucy - he found my "strident voice" annoying but presumed I was " in character"!</p>

                <p>Being part of Genesis Theatre was exciting and rewarding. I worked with some great people and learnt a lot. A great time in my life that will never be forgotten.</p>
