                <h1>Chapter 4. Stag</h1>

                <p>At university I did a joint honours degree in both Drama and English. For my English thesis, as has
                    been just mentioned, I focussed on Lancashire dialect writing with reference to key local political
                    events (such as Peterloo). For my Drama
                    thesis, my enquiry centred around the influence of early folk and pagan rituals on the later
                    development of theatre. I became fascinated by such rituals and customs and traditions and wanted to
                    find ways of harnessing their raw dramatic
                    power and energy into new contemporary work. This had been the impetus behind parts of 'The Tall
                    Tree' (see above) which had incorporated Morris dancing and a Mummers Play. It was written alongside
                    the development of a song cycle Chris
                    and I worked on in the early 70's around the former community of Shaw Town, an area that bordered
                    Flixton and Urmston, where Chris and I had each grown up. I suppose, looking back, we wanted to try
                    and trace a line of continuity between
                    the lives of the people who lived there when it was still known as Shaw Town with the town we knew
                    ourselves and now saw around us. For the through line we wrote about a road, a cinder path known
                    locally as Penny Lane, believe it or
                    not, which linked various key landmarks that can still be found today nestling between the new
                    estates:</p>

                <p class="text_centre"><i>From Brooklyn Grange to De Brooke Court Farm</i></p>
                <p class="text_centre"><i>The road runs ever on</i></p>
                <p class="text_centre"><i>Copper Beech tree, Sycamore, lean</i></p>
                <p class="text_centre"><i>Towards the sun</i></p>
                <p class="text_centre"><i>And grow...</i></p>

                <p class="text_centre"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

                <p class="text_centre"><i>And in the silence if you strain</i></p>
                <p class="text_centre"><i>Your ears you might just hear</i></p>
                <p class="text_centre"><i>(The sound of) hunting horns and horses' hooves</i></p>
                <p class="text_centre"><i>Swiftly drawing near -</i></p>
                <p class="text_centre"><i>Whoa!</i></p>

                <p>With 'Stag' we wanted to take this much further and much deeper. That incursion of the past breaking
                    through in occasional glimpses and echoes – that was the kind of thing I think I was trying to
                    capture.</p>

                <p>'Stag' tells the story* of a young, musically gifted young woman (Sally) who becomes haunted as a
                    child by a series of recurring dreams, dominated by the mysterious and enigmatic figure of Herne the
                    Hunter. Then in life Sally has a few
                    key encounters with strangers that significantly shape the future course of her life. These
                    strangers might, or might not, be incarnations of Herne, re-enactments of her dreams; or they may
                    just be the manifestations of a growing psychosis.
                    The audience is left to decide.</p>

                <p><i>(*A fuller version of the story can be found on the sleeve notes of the CD of all the music put
                        together some years ago by Chris).</i></p>

                <p>Instead of the more conventional romances with their happy-ever-after endings that one normally
                    associates with the musical genre, we wanted to subvert and replace those with something that was
                    altogether darker, more Gothic and infused
                    with the traditions of pagan folk rituals, while remaining firmly rooted in the contemporary.</p>

                <p>To help us realise this ambition, initially we had the story focus on the possibility of Sally
                    re-enacting an ages-old ritual that allowed us to slip the narrative between two very distinct
                    time-frames, and we used the Shaw Town Song Cycle
                    as a framework for this, while we also brought back the White Rose Queen and The Tall Tree from that
                    first play we had collaborated on. In addition we wrote a great many new songs, so that by the time
                    we were ready to start rehearsals
                    there were well over 30 songs, and the contemporary aspect of the story itself shifted between the
                    70's and the 50's, this too being reflected musically.</p>

                <p>It was certainly original and quite unlike most people's idea of a traditional musical, and it had a
                    certain mysterious and powerful atmospheric hold that it wielded over audiences, but it was also
                    quite a mess, with the narrative lurching
                    all over the place. The shifts in time, though necessary, were confusing; the realisation of the
                    distant pagan past far too specific (and therefore no longer frightening), and the slipping between
                    dreaming and waking far too arbitrary.
                    It was also, at something like three and a half hours, way too long, and I don't think anybody
                    really understood what was going on. Even Chris and I were unsure at times, and we'd written the
                    thing!</p>

                <p>Having said that, Chris once again did a quite magnificent job in writing a brilliant score: the
                    music is astonishing in its breadth and variety, and is always judged exactly right. He again put
                    together another fantastic band, using many
                    of the musicians who had played for 'Hair' plus a number of additions, notably Alan on sax. The cast
                    responded gamely to not really knowing what the whole thing was about and demonstrated again the
                    real strength and hallmark of a Genesis
                    production – the superb, committed ensemble playing – and there were particularly memorable central
                    performances by Alison Davis as Sally and Louis Grant as Herne, who exhibited a real chemistry
                    between them and made the whole preposterous
                    plot utterly plausible by their skill and integrity.</p>

                <p>When it finished its first run (at Altrincham Garrick again in 1977) I knew that we hadn't pulled it
                    off as I had hoped. But I also knew that underneath all the extraneous “stuff” that cluttered it all
                    up, so that it had practically sunk
                    beneath the sheer weight and volume of the material, there was the nugget of a really good show: we
                    just hadn't found it yet. Two years later, however, in 1979 at The Grange Arts Centre Oldham and
                    again at The Royal Exchange Manchester,
                    I believe that we did.</p>
