                <h1>Chapter 15. Epilogue</h1>

                <p>And so – this has been my account of the story of Genesis Theatre, and especially those heady,
                    formative, life-changing years between 1975 and 1979, when we were most active and when for everyone
                    involved, it became a way of life. To all
                    who ever took part in a Genesis production, whether as a member of the cast, the band, the singers;
                    as a technician, a stage manager; or if you were involved in any other capacity – this account is
                    dedicated to you, with enormous thanks.
                    Our productions made incredible demands of all who took part, and it was the capacity always to go
                    that extra mile which forged that particular spirit of commitment, togetherness and loyalty and
                    support, which so typified what it felt
                    like to be a part of those times, and which so distinguished Genesis from other theatre groups. It
                    was a cause, and we all believed in it. And as well, we all had a great time doing so. Equally as
                    strong as my memories of the shows
                    and rehearsals are the social times, the parties (especially those in Ali's cellar), the calling
                    round on one another unexpectedly, the weekends away together. And though, inevitably, those times
                    could not last, they touched, I am
                    certain, everyone who was involved: we all knew that those times were special while they were
                    happening and took full advantage of them. And so our thoughts inevitably go out to those who are no
                    longer with us – Nicky, Paul Arstall,
                    Graham, Chris Shepherd, Shirley, Stevie (and others who I might not be aware of).</p>

                <p>Finally, I began this memoir with a description of how Chris D and I first began writing songs
                    together, and it is this relationship which has outlasted all of the others; and it is thanks to
                    Chris that this Genesis website exists; it
                    is he who still acts as the glue binding the memories together; and he still continues to compose
                    great music in a range of different contexts. Who knows – maybe the two of us might still have one
                    more collaboration left in us...?</p>

                <p>Thank you.</p>
