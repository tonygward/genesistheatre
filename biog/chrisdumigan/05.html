                <h1>Chapter 5. Demolition Man</h1>

                <p>During the lull after Stag, Arthur Dutton (our Mr Fix-it as we all knew him) came across a 1-hour
                    made-for-television musical starring the singer Jimmy Helms (a popular soul singer during the
                    1970's). A rather slight and innocuous programme,
                    it caught Arthur's attention and he presented it for our perusal at a subsequent meeting. Having
                    already bought the LP soundtrack from some remote shop or other, the songs were there for all to
                    hear. Arthur felt this was an ideal vehicle
                    for us to showcase our talents, as it was almost certain never to have been performed on stage. All
                    we had to do was contact the writers.</p>

                <p><img src="images/hair (49).jpg" class="left" alt="Mary" /> On the face of it the songs initially were
                    somewhat bland, the actual storyline a little lacking and unlike Arthur many of us couldn't see the
                    programme's finer points. We wondered
                    just how good a show it would actually make. After all it was a huge contrast to our previous
                    production. Everyone's initial wariness about the suitability of the show soon vanished when we got
                    deeper into it all. The show's composer
                    John King was only too happy to help us in any way, with a short score and a script, although band
                    parts had to be filled out by myself helped by what had now become the Genesis Theatre band. We
                    chose to go ahead with it.</p>

                <p>It was now May 1977 and this decision to put on Demolition Man, coincided with the Royal Exchange
                    Theatre running a competition, the winners of which would be allowed to present their show on stage
                    in front of a full audience with the
                    benefit of all the usual professional help from the theatre. The contest was to run for two weeks,
                    every winner got one day in the theatre and no more. We presented Demolition Man, because we hoped
                    that it would attract their interest,
                    as it had never been done anywhere except in that one-hour television format.
                </p>

                <p>To cut a long story short, we won, and on August 1st 1977 Genesis Theatre were to get their day at
                    the Royal Exchange Theatre!</p>

                <p>The show itself required only two major leads, a black singer, who was quickly cast in the form of
                    our own Louis Grant and a glamorous lady he meets on his travels, who was cast in the elegant form
                    of Mary Clark! All but a small handful
                    of the songs were to be sung by one or both of them. So it was important to get two good singers and
                    two equally glamorous leads, as they were to spend 90% of the time on stage non-stop.</p>

                <p><img src="images/stag_056.jpg" class="right" alt="Louis" /> A little before we started rehearsals for
                    the show I had bought a Fender Rhodes keyboard with the intention of using it in Demolition Man. The
                    recording used a string synthesizer,
                    so we also borrowed a Logan String Synth for me. The Genesis Theatre band featured only three past
                    members, Chas Coghill on Lead Guitar, Alan Barnes on Sax and of course me! Neil and Mike were sadly
                    unavailable, so instead Alan Ratcliff
                    stepped up to the drum stool and Paul Morell picked up the bass. After a very ragged start with the
                    new line up, things improved dramatically and we developed into a very tight unit. The singers
                    although all very good, were completely
                    outclassed right from the start by Louis who simply shone out like a beacon even in the early
                    rehearsals. It soon became obvious to everyone what a great, uncomplicated and fun family show this
                    was going to be.</p>

                <p>Well the great day dawned and we got into the Royal Exchange at just gone 9.00 a.m. and spent most of
                    the morning setting up. My initial reaction to the place was one of shock! It was so intimate, the
                    audience is right on top of you; you
                    can literally see the whites of their eyes. I started to flinch at the thought of the inevitable
                    sound problems we were going to have... and boy did we ever have sound problems! The professional
                    sound guy seemed to take an immediate
                    dislike to us and spent the majority of the day picking holes in our sound (and it's volume)! He
                    proceeded to screen off the Fender Rhodes completely. I put a stop to that straight away, and moved
                    the Fender away from the general direction
                    of the audience and we therefore reached a viable compromise.</p>

                <p>The dress rehearsal was very ragged, so we did another! Better, but not perfect. We stopped at 6.00
                    p.m. to eat and generally chill out for a bit, if such a thing was possible with only 1 ½ hours to
                    go! I was mentally and physically jiggered
                    by this time, but by the start of the evening performance, bucked up for the show which from start
                    to finish was electric! Not only did it go like a dream, the audience loved every single second of
                    it and showed their appreciation
                    at every available space by applauding heartily. But even I didn't guess how the end-bows would go.
                    After we'd all done our bows to tumultuous applause, the last piece finished and we stopped... but
                    the audience didn't! They carried
                    on yelling, shouting and applauding like they were not going to stop.</p>

                <p>We were all very moved and it was truly an unforgettable experience. But then I was faced with a
                    dilemma, because I didn't know whether to play it again and hope that everyone else, who was out of
                    sight, would come back and join in, or
                    to wait for some sign. Everyone might have gone back to the dressing rooms and be ignorant of the
                    chaos. Mary and Louis finally saved the day by reappearing, so we shrugged and did the final piece
                    again. Thankfully everyone returned
                    to the stage. We were all so happy that nobody in the dancers bothered with the routine, they just
                    stood around clapping, jumping around, and hugging one another. What a night!</p>
