                <h1>Chapter 3. Hair (Genesis Theatre)</h1>

                <p>A meeting was held by the 'management' of the Metropolitan on 23rd March 1976, wherein Robert William
                    Bromley and company informed us that the next show was going to be West Side Story. We quite
                    politely at first pointed out that we had
                    created the show and had the right to a say in the next production. Robert William Bromley, being
                    inexperienced and somewhat aloof from the whole camaraderie of the production by his own choice, had
                    made himself completely unpopular.
                    He overruled us.</p>

                <p><img src="images/hair_041.jpg" class="left"
                        alt="Nicky Baird in Hair... expressing the general mood" /> So we walked out on him, went to a
                    nearby pub, held a little meeting of our own, and created Genesis Theatre. Graham Brittain became
                    our chairman, with Arthur Dutton as the vice-chairman, and various others in a number of responsible
                    roles. Our decision that night was to re-do Hair, as Genesis Theatre which we did on the 27th to the
                    30th October 1976 at the Lancastrian
                    Theatre, Swinton.</p>

                <p>As mentioned earlier, we had problems with the copyright owners regarding our alterations and Charles
                    Manson references. Second time around, with advanced notice, they firmly refused to grant us
                    permission to do the show with these references
                    in. So this time they were gone, to be replaced by dialogue lifted from other areas of the show,
                    which helped to serve the same purpose as previously but because it was in the original script they
                    could not stop us doing it. You could
                    mess around with original dialogue as much as you wanted, but you could not wholesale invent it or
                    drag it in from elsewhere. So we were OK to go ahead.</p>

                <p><img src="images/hair_039.jpg" class="right" alt="Hair had a sense of rebellion..." /> The band was
                    largely as before except for Dave Sayer, a pro musician who had other commitments, who was replaced
                    by Graham Gooch on Organ. All the main
                    cast were identical, but a number of the family had gone to be replaced by new members. This
                    swapping of people would continue throughout Genesis' lifespan, as people on the 'second rung' so to
                    speak came and went whenever they wanted,
                    but the hard core of about twelve people were always there.</p>

                <p>The show went ahead very well indeed. It was more streamlined without the Charles Manson references
                    and more humorous. Mike Cheesman really hammed it up this time as Claude and it was a much more
                    balanced show as a result. This version
                    of the show was also recorded and is interesting because it includes various songs written for Hair
                    by the original writers, but discarded for one reason or another along the way. We discovered these
                    extras via an album called "Fresh
                    Hair", which explained that these were off-Broadway numbers that never made it to the final version.
                    We received permission to include them, and the show changed quite considerably as a result. The
                    press again were very nice to us,
                    and afterward we finally put away our scripts and music for Hair for the last time.</p>

                <p class="align_centre"><img src="images/hair_024.jpg" alt="Group shot from Hair" /></p>
                <p>A note in my scrapbooks at the time makes the comment that it was worth doing again so that we could
                    completely get the show out of our system, but "would we ever do that?" I wondered. Looking back
                    after twenty-six years I can state quite
                    categorically, no we didn't. Whenever any of us get together as a group and someone plays the
                    opening notes of Aquarius, the response is electric. I think everyone still knows his or her
                    harmonies after more than two decades away from
                    it.
                </p>

                <p>So Hair was gone.</p>

                <p>Long live Hair.</p>

                <p>But what next for Genesis Theatre?</p>
