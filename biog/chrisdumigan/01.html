                <h1>Chapter 1. A Beginning</h1>

                <p>To explain how Genesis Theatre began I have to go back to a time before Genesis Theatre had even been considered, to a time of Robert William Bromley and the Metropolitan Amateur Operatic Society. It was Saturday 7th June 1975, at a party
                    at Robin Kelly's house, when he and his old friend Jane were going off to London and I was asked by Robert William Bromley to be Musical Director of a new amateur society, who were going to produce 'Hair'.</p>

                <p>At the time I knew nothing about the show, although I knew it contained a piece called 'Aquarius' and a well publicised nude scene (!). Later I was to learn that Hair is a musical firmly entrenched in the 60's, a time of protests, social
                    unrest and draft dodging. The hippie culture was a product of this time, the family as presented in this show represents this clash between the old traditional values and the new free spirited movements.</p>

                <p>The excitement of the unknown together with the chance to take part in something quite new to me on a musical level (plus my old friend Chris Fogg was to be the director of the show) was too good an opportunity to turn down. Even though
                    at this time I had never been on stage for more than a few minutes playing my guitars and had certainly never been responsible for a big stage production, I accepted.</p>

                <p>The next thing to happen were the auditions, that took place in a scout hut in Urmston, adverts having duly been splashed all over the local papers. That set of auditions was an event that is indelibly burnt into my brain. How to explain
                    in a few sentences the myriad weird, wonderful, and awful things that were seen and heard that night? Loads of people turned up, many very good, some OK, but would do better with time and effort, and a few god - awful, are they joking
                    or what ?!?, people who really were a sight to behold. Suffice it to say that they individually had to sing a portion of a song from Hair, which (unsurprisingly) was 'Aquarius', do a spot of dance movement with Lynda Burton, the choreographer,
                    and read a bit of dialogue with Chris Fogg. Many people turned up that night that became life-long friends, and who 27 years later are still some of my oldest friends, but more of that later. It is the also- rans, and the frankly bizarre,
                    that deserve a mention here.</p>

                <p>For example the married couple who had come a long way, and who had to both pass the audition. Neither one wanted to do it without the other. Well to cut a long story short, she sang beautifully, a gorgeous voice. I cannot remember what
                    her dancing or acting was like, but I do remember we were all pleased. Then it was her husband's turn. I did the usual intro for Aquarius, and he didn't come in on the right note. Not only was it not the right note, it was not in this
                    known universe of right notes. He was so far off the mark, that only a dog could probably appreciate how far off he was! I, at a loss quite what to say, turned round to see Chris and Lynda facing away from me, to hide their expressions.
                    It didn't matter; I could tell by the way their shoulders were jumping up and down just what they thought of it all. Needless to say she passed, and he didn't, which meant that we lost her as well, because she wouldn't do it without
                    him.
                </p>

                <p>Now, you might think that I am exaggerating, you know the sort of thing, artistic license. After all, if he was just borderline mediocre, it wouldn't be such a great story would it? No, he was the worst of the worst. No, even worse than
                    that. He was so far away from the mark that even 27 years later, just the mention of the incident to Chris is enough to put him into fits of hysterics. I have truly never before or since heard his like, and believe me, I have heard
                    and seen some god forsaken awful singers in my life!</p>

                <p>There was also Jan Wunderli, a coloratura soprano, who when she came in with her opening notes, nearly broke every window in the place, and my glasses lenses as well! Loud?!? Loud wasn't the word for it. Or the lovely black girl who came
                    along whose name was Stone. Precious Stone. No joke. A smashing kid, but have you ever-considered come into a room, greeting your friends, and having to say 'Hi Precious!' It gives people the wrong sort of idea about you right away!</p>

                <p>Well, by the end of the evening we had our cast. The rehearsals followed swiftly on and went on for several months, accompanied by lots of press interest. After all it was a show with a 'Nude Scene' wasn't it? And were we really going
                    to do that bit, they all asked? We stood our ground and kept shtum. They'd have to come and see for themselves.</p>
